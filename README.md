# Refresh current Sitecore Hackathon website using Sitecore JSS

## Module Purpose

To meet the objective of 2020 Hackathon for topic "Sitecore Hackathon Website"

## Module Sitecore Hackathon Category
Sitecore Hackathon Website in JSS

## How to setup the Sitecore JSS application:

-	Setup your JSS App with name “AKS” from files available at https://github.com/Sitecore-Hackathon/2020-AKS/tree/master/src
-	Install node modules using command npm install -g @sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-cli
-	Start the app using command – jss start

## Why JSS

-	To enable front end developers to work in disconnected mode without having Sitecore instance in their machine. This reduce the license dependency for Sitecore development.
-	To enable behavior and content to be consumed from Sitecore and functionality to come from other front-end technologies.
-	Headless will make development of applications possible with Sitecore which means the information architecture and presentation architecture is decoupled.
-	Apps can be built entirely disconnected from Sitecore - then deployed to Sitecore later (Sitecore install not required)
